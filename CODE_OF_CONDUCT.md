# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

As members, contributors, and leaders, we pledge to create a welcoming, inclusive, and respectful community for everyone. We commit to making participation in our community a harassment-free experience, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

We aim to foster a positive community environment by demonstrating empathy, kindness, and respect towards others. We value diverse opinions, viewpoints, and experiences and strive to accept responsibility for our actions and learn from our mistakes. We focus on the best interests of the community as a whole and are committed to providing constructive feedback gracefully.

However, we consider the following behaviors unacceptable in our community:

* Using sexualized language or imagery, and making any form of sexual attention or advances
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Harassing anyone publicly or privately
* Publishing someone's private information, such as their physical or email address, without explicit permission
* Any other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for ensuring that our standards of acceptable behavior are clear and enforced fairly. We will take appropriate corrective action if any behavior is deemed inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct. When making moderation decisions, they will communicate the reasons for their actions.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all community spaces and situations, whether online or offline. It also applies to any individual officially representing our community in public spaces, such as using an official email address, posting on an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an event.

## Enforcement

If you witness or experience any abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior, please report it to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at [INSERT CONTACT METHOD]. We will investigate all complaints promptly and fairly.

We respect the privacy and security of anyone who reports an incident.
